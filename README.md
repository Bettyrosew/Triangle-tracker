#### By Bettyrose Waithera
## Description
This is a website which takes in three lengths or as user input to determine which triangle can be formed from the lengths. There are only three triangles which can be formed including ;equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle and scalene triangle. There are several javascript functions that have been put to place to be able to easily determine the type of triangle formed after user inputs. This has been done in a way that if all the lengths are equal it is an equilateral triangle , if two lengths are equal it is an isosceles triangle and if none of the lengths are equal it is a scalene triangle. Also,if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle cannot be formed completely.
