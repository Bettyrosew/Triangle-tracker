  <h2>What exactly can the triangle-tracker do? </h2>
    <p>The <span class="intro">triangle-tracker</span> is able to take in any lengths and determine what kind of triangle will be formed out of those lengths provided by the user. As you know, there are three types of triangles: equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle and scalene triangle (diagrams shown below) . However, if the lengths are not suitable to form a triangle the tracker will also alert the user.</p>
